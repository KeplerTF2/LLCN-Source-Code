Hey dude! Mike… It’s me Stan, you’re probably wondering, why on earth would I want to go back to this place? Well like, since you’re such a good friend, I think you deserve to know. You know that ‘Real One’ I found? Well, I know who he is. I don’t intend on keeping him, you know. He did a lot of awful stuff, a lot. I have plans for him. You want to know who he is don’t ya? I think you’d rather not know. I don’t think you’d want to see him, and find out the truth. If you don’t want to know, you should probably quit working with me. If you do want to, however, carry on working with me, work at the attraction and you’ll see what this is all about. But let me warn you, this was never a business venture, it’s vengeance, for what he did to you, to us. The place will burn with him inside, you can’t control that. The place won’t even open to the public. It’s all a rouse, a facade to trick who I have found, and put him in his place. Once and for all. Thank you for helping me in this endeavour, it has been greatly appreciated, Mr Afton.
