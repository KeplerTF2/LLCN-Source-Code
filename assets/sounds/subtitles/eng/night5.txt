Hey there man! Cool thing I found finally, some old employee training tapes, just listen to this! Hello? Hello? Um welcome to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. A magical place for kids and grownups alike. This tape is to instruct staff on how this pizzeria is run now after the incident. First, you must not tell anyone about the old sprint lock suits. Those things are safety hazards and should never have been allowed to have been used. Second, children must now stay in the central seating area, accompanied by at least 3 members of staff and at least one adult per family. This is to minimise the chances of any predators being able to lure children away. Yeah, it’s not ideal I know but it’s what we have to do to protect the children now. Third thing, anyone in this restaurant who witnesses an event of which includes traumatic injury should immediately be refer- We don’t need to listen to those things all night, although like I’m pretty sure I’ve accidentally triggered them randomly playing on the systems, so um if your phone starts ringing you might want to pick it up if it like totally annoys you. Well, that’s it for now, see you later dude.
