Hello? Hey! Um, I didn’t expect to get the rights to this place, but like, I’m guessing if you owned a rotting building, you’d probably want to get rid of it, ASAP. Um, so I’ve hired you to help me look for props for a new Freddy’s Fazbear’s horror attraction! (name pending), but like, we can’t actually use the building itself. It’s um, probably bit of a fire hazard. So, your job is to make sure I’m like super safe whilst I’m collecting stuff, um, you’ve got some different sounds on your camera to use, just in case the animatronics move, but they won’t. Um, lemme explain them to ya now, I’ve like colour coded them. So, the green one should lure animatronics, the yellow one should stall them, keep them in one place you know, and the red one will just like um, uh, oh yeah, uh completely deter them. You should like use that one if an animatronic is right outside your office. You shouldn’t, like,  have to use those, but just in case you do, they’re there. Um, my systems will probably like interfere with the cameras, I’ll probably appear as just like static, but it should be fine. Oh and one more thing, good batteries for these systems are really expensive, so um make sure you don’t like use them too much. I’ll be following the sounds that your making on your camera to the right door in your office, try not to creep yourself out too much bro, alright? Alright.
