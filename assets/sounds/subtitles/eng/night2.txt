Hey! Another night on the job! Like, I would do this during the day, but um, I’m a bit of a night owl ya know? Anyway, found some cool stuff, um mostly just cool lights and stage props. I uh also found this sealed up room, so I’ll try and get there another night. I uh like don’t have the proper equipment right now… but hey! We’re here to find as many things as possible alright? Um I noticed foxy in his cove was twitching a bit, like from what I’ve heard he likes to run down hallways ya know, so maybe like don’t let that happen. Don’t want a prop to run away from us do we? Um If you do catch him running down a hallway, one of those sounds should probably work on him. But like, you’d have to do it quickly. Yeah I forgot to mention I found him but uh, he’s mostly just an endoskeleton now, not much to like salvage. Also, like, do you know when I got to that room outside your office? Well like the door to get in there kinda locks up. So um if anyone were to go in there, their only way out would be through you office. That’s alright for me, but probably not if a ‘killer animatronic’ gets there, ya know? Well that’s all I have to say, see you in a bit.
