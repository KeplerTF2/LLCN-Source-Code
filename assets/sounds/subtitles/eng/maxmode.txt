I always knew you'd come back. It's in your blood. His bloodstains lie deeper than your hands, don't they? I'll bet his screams still echo through your head, his cries for help still resonate around your mind.  Well I'll tell you one thing.  They won't… fucking… leave me… alone.  The memory of that night haunts me, just as I have haunted you. You always knew I was here, waiting. Well I've felt the agony of your pathetic brother's death tenfold. I've felt how it feels. Perhaps you'd care to join me in that? You didnt seriously think I'd let you leave me like this, trapped in this rotting carcass of a business, fading away into memory, until I was forgotten entirely? I know full well you weren't content to forget about him, so what makes me any different? All these years I've decayed here, with no one but the sorry remnants of these shells as company.
