Hey dude! Guess what, I found two animatronics! They’re probably not functional but they’ll serve great as decoration. Like, I found it strange Freddy wasn’t there though… whats that? He’s in your office? Siiick dude! Awesome that’s great. Um I heard that when this place was actually open that Freddy didn’t like it to be noisy. So like try and be quiet alright? Though that’s probably hard with the sounds on your system, you’d probably want to turn those sounds off if Freddy perks up. Anyway, since like you didn’t want to for whatever reason, I did manage to find someone willing to take the role of the security guard when the horror attraction opens. Um anyway like, do you have any name suggestions? Sure this place is frightening but I can seem to think of a good name man…
