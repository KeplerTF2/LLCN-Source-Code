Hey there! Guess what, big surprise here. I got into the sealed room, and there was a functional one. One I can actually use! Incredible I know! Can’t have a Freddy’s themed horror attraction without some half functioning animatronics, which the rest of these certainly aren’t. Like though, it kinda of stunk, but like that just adds to the atmosphere you know? Hey you should be in there! Oh yeah, um turns out the animatronics do move, so, I guess we’ve got to be a bit cautious like, but it’ll be fine. There’s nothing to worry about. Although if there is one that’s about to get ya, maybe you could try playing dead? You know, they can only detect movement so just stay still. Anyway, I don’t have much else to tell you tonight, so like I’ll be off dude.
